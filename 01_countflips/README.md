## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** (version 8 or higher)
- A code editor (like VSCode, IntelliJ, or Eclipse) or a terminal to run Java code.

---

## How It Works
1. The program prompts the user to enter a string.
2. It processes the input by comparing adjacent characters.
3. If two adjacent characters are **different**, it increments a flip counter.
4. Finally, the total count of flips is displayed.

---

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository or download the code files.

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Open the project in your preferred code editor or navigate to the project folder in a terminal.

3. Compile the Java code using the following command:

    ```bash
    javac CountFlips.java
    ```

4. Run the compiled code:

    ```bash
    java CountFlips
    ```

## Usage
1. After running the code, you will be prompted to **enter a string**.
2. Type the string and press **Enter**.
3. The program will display the **flip count**.
